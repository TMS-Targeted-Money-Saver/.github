# TMS: Targeted Money Saver (android)

<p align="justify">
Using TMS: Targeted Money Saver, users can effortlessly manage their savings by setting financial goals, such as saving for a new gadget or a new item they want to buy in the future, and tracking their progress daily. The app enables users to upload an image of the item they wish to set a goal for. It then identifies the item, displays its name and price, and allows users to select their desired timeline to achieve the goal. Based on this information, the system calculates and provides the daily savings amount needed to reach the target, which are then visualized through an interactive progress bar. This feature provides real-time feedback, showing how much closer they are to achieving their target and how much more is needed to reach it.

The application aims to simplify financial management and foster better saving habits, especially among students and young professionals. By offering a straightforward and engaging way to monitor savings, the app encourages consistent contributions while helping users make informed decisions about their spending. With its user-friendly interface and motivational design, TMS: Targeted Money Saver transforms the process of achieving financial goals into an accessible and rewarding experience.
